*** = STRETCH GOAL

# Project 4 - Pitch:
This is a musician lesson app where the user can login, and connect live with a musician that is offering lessons.  Both the student and the teacher will have their own profiles.  The student will be able to scroll through a list of teachers and find the one that is experienced with the instrument that they would like to learn.  The student can then book an appointment with the teacher on our platform, and will be provided with a link to a zoom room to meet.


## STRETCH GOALS
- Chat feature between students and teachers
- Teacher will have a calendar to schedule time for lessons


## Working Title: Music Platform


## Nick Hvattum, Zack Barovsky, & Salman Malik (The new and improved "Zack and da the Boizz")


## Technologies Used:
- Frontend: TypeScript/JS/React
- Backend: Mongo
- Websocket (for chat feature between user and teacher)

### Backend
- Mongo React Auth
- Will try to use GraphiQl

Table user {
  id int [pk]
  name string
  email string [unique]
  password string
  isTeacher boolean
  bio text[500]
  profile pic
  instrumentsPlayed text[100]
  qr code? (image for payment)
}


## Frontend
- Searchbar for teacher to search for student with add student button
- Upon payment, Zoom link will be distributed
- Will use Stripe to pay for lessons with teacher
